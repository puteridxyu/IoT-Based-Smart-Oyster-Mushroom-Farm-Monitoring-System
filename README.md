# IoT-Based-Smart-Oyster-Mushroom-Farm-Monitoring-System

This project is an IoT-based smart monitoring system designed for oyster mushroom farms. The system leverages modern technologies to monitor and optimize the growth environment of the mushrooms, ensuring optimal conditions for cultivation.

The system is built using React.js for the user interface, Firebase for real-time data storage and management, MQTT for efficient communication between sensors and the server, and Flask for the backend API. We also utilize NeuralProphet for predictive analytics to forecast environmental conditions and various sensors to collect data on temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, and more.

By integrating these technologies, the system provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing the farm environment, helping to enhance the yield and quality of the mushrooms.
